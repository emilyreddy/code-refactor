# Description
Horiseon is a marketing company, and they have a website. However, their website lacks proper search engine optimization. And for a marketing company, that's a pretty big deal.

Enter the purpose of this project: to fix (refactor) their codebase so that it follows accessibility standards, thus vastly improving the site's SEO.

The achieve this goal, the following aspects of the code were refactored:

Generic HTML elements were replaced with semantic HTML elements
Alt text were added to images
Comments were added to describe the sections
CSS was reorganized and revised to follow the changes to the HTML
CSS selectors were reorganized and revised
the title element was changed to be more descriptive
After completing those changes, Horiseon's website SEO was improved. Thus, this project shows that a few technical changes can go a long way in helping an existing website become so much more.
